        <h2>Brooke</h2>
        <h4>(Maid Of Honor)</h4>
        <p>Brooke’s mom, Lori and my mom Grace were good friends since their 20’s. Come 1994 Brooke and I met and we
          were best friends. Over the years we did everything together from family trips to Disney world to yearly
          vacations to Outer Banks. She is the one person I can turn to no matter the situation may be. We have always
          had a strong bond and there’s no one else I rather have as my maid of honor.</p>

        <h2>Colleen</h2>
        <p>Growing up I always looked up to Colleen as a big sister rather then a cousin. As we get older she has become
          one of my closest friends and has always had my back. I am blessed to have her by my side.</p>

        <p>Ashley actually knew Bryan years before I knew her. Bryan and Ashley met in high school and were in the same
          graduating class. Through mutual friends and working at the Twinsburg fitness Center together we became close
          friends. Over the years we have had countless nights drinking wine and having heart to heart
          conversations.</p>

        <h2>Amanda</h2>
        <p>Amanda is more then Bryan’s sister, she is a friend. We always have a good time when we are together and she
          is the little sister I’ve always wanted. I am so honored she is standing by my side at my wedding and I can’t
          wait to get closer in the years to come.</p>
